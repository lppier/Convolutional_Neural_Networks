# Exploration of Convolutional Neural Networks

**cnn_breakdown.py**

This code demonstrates the role of filters in convolutional neural networks
Two filters are created, a horizontal line filter and a vertical line filter of 7 x 7 pixels each.
The two filters are used to do convolution with the input images and the output feature images are shown. 

One can observe that the different filters "sieve out" different features in the feature-mapped images.
